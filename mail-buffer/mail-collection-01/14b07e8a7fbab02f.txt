Hi Tünde

1. ext2 is now very old. Pretty much every current Linux filesystem is a journaling filesystem these days (I can't think of one that isn't, off the top of my head). I believe that when our engineers looked at disabling journaling they found very little difference in terms of speed -- and any increase there was, was outweighed by the fact that a crash would require a full fsck of the filesystem when the machine reboots, which is extremely painful if you have a 36TB worker node...


2. I'm not aware of any specific papers or tests, but that's a fairly well-accepted rule of thumb. More important than just the performance impact, though, is the fact that you need to build a pretty complex set of rules to allow all the relevant daemons to talk to each other on all the ports they need -- and that an update to Hadoop could easily break things.

Hi all,





The students asked me a couple of questions

	What is the reason why we don’t mention non-journaling filesystems (they asked esp. for ext2)? What is cloudera’s stand point for this? What would the performance implications be?
	Regarding SELinux : do we have any tests/papers or something which underlines that the performance impact is 7-10% and why? And what is the required complex configuration?






I will also try to look up some answers after the course, but was hoping that somebody just knows the answers :)
