Pavan Kumar commented on GIRAPH-877:
------------------------------------

the provided patch uses the correct equation (accounting for sink) & is production tested
    double value = d * sum + (d * sinkSum / n) + (1.0 - d) * allSum / n;

in SimplePageRankComputation the formula used is
   double value = d * sum + (1.0 - d) / n;
so it does not account for weights, etc.
