Hello,

Unfortunately, my proposal wasn't selected for GSoC this year, actually, I was surprised that only 39 projects projects were accepted by Apache (that's low considering the number of projects supported by the foundation) and none of them were related to Giraph, which is a shame.
Anyway, I think I've gone too far to let the effort die now, so I'd like to make this contribution anyway, I even got the code started already.
So, what would be the best way to do it? Should I fork the master branch in GitHub and send a pull request when everything is ready?
Mirko, would you still be interested in helping me out by reviewing the code, trying it out, or simply providing some comments?


Many thanks to both of you and, hopefully, next year Giraph will be amongst the selected projects.


Best regards,
Gianluca Righetto

Hello Mirko and Avery,

I'm sending this message just to let you both know that I officially submitted my project proposal to Google Summer of Code, given you two were the ones who showed some interest in supporting the project.
You can take a look at the proposal in Google's Melange platform here:Â http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/public/google/gsoc2014/gianlucar/5629499534213120


Thanks,
