Hi all,





The students asked me a couple of questions

	What is the reason why we don’t mention non-journaling filesystems (they asked esp. for ext2)? What is cloudera’s stand point for this? What would the performance implications be?
	Regarding SELinux : do we have any tests/papers or something which underlines that the performance impact is 7-10% and why? And what is the required complex configuration?






I will also try to look up some answers after the course, but was hoping that somebody just knows the answers :)







Met vriendelijke groet/Kind regards/Tisztelettel,
