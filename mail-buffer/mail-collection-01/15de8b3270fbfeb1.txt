Arun and I responded directly to Matt, but a few quick notes for visibility.

1.  We used btrfs during beta to enable consistent snapshots for backup.  Post 1.0 we allow users to bring their own disk configuration, and default to ext4 if given an unformatted block device.  BTRFS should not be used going forward.  RHEL is dropping future support and we've seen lockups on COTTS and now at General Mills.  Moving off BTRFS just requires shutting down CDSW and copying files in /var/lib/cdsw.  In general you should carefully think about disk configuration and backup strategy for /var/lib/cdsw as this is where all the application state is stored.


2.  We don't yet have a good solution to dynamic port callbacks.   We tracking this for TensflowOnSpark in DSE-1697, but it applies to h20 as well.


3.  We are tracking the 128 issue with autofs external mount in Escalation DSE-2377.   Feel free to follow the discussion there for details.

Hi Dan/Scott

 

I have a call scheduled to go over a few CDSW questions with General Mills tomorrow.  In preparation, they sent me a few specific questions.  I have reached out to Tristan regarding the BTRFS and Status 128 questions below but was hoping one of you may have some insights into their last question which specifically is about the ability to expose a listening port for a container with a dyamic port on the physical host.  They would like to use this as a callback for H2O where the driver (running in a CDSW container) initiates a connection to the Hadoop cluster and kicks off a h2O cluster. That cluster then tries to call back into the container, but ultimately fails because of the port mapping behavior with docker.

 

Do you know if this is possible or if this is a question better suited to the broader CDSW Engineering/SME team?

 

Regards,

Hi, I’m on the Linux team at GMI.
 
Regarding the status 128 errors, there is very little diagnostics outside of “status 128” – but we do get some errors indicating there are too many levels of symbolic links on the mount point once the issue occurs. Simply restarting autofs on all the hosts in the cluster seems to clear the problem for a while. We think the issue is a bug in docker and autofs: https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/24303
 
For the callback bit, basically Reshu’s team would like to be able to expose a listening port for a container with a dynamic port on the physical host. In the case of H20, it’s a callback port where the driver (running in a CDSW container) initiates a connection to the Hadoop cluster and kicks off a h2O cluster. That cluster then tries to call back into the container, but ultimately fails because of the port mapping behavior with docker.
 
I’ll let Todd commend on the BTRFS question, but I think we’re planning on migrating to EXT4 per Cloudera support. Ideally CDSW would cease to deploy BTRFS at install time.
 
Regards,
Jon Benning

Thank you for the agenda details.  For preparation sake, I have a few questions:

·         Is there a case number with support for the BTRFS issue you experienced?
·         Can you provide a little more context on the status 128 error you experienced?
·         We will need to dig into your question about callbacks tomorrow so I can better understand how you are trying to use this capability
If 30 minutes is not enough time, we can schedule a follow-on discussion.

 

Matt

Hi Matt,

 

In the agenda for this month’s connect, we have quite a few items identified. So I am guessing 30 minutes may not be enough. We can discuss the first few functionality related agenda items in the first meeting and use this extended invite for very specific technical issues/feature requests. I have invited only core members from GMI who need to be part of this detailed technical discussion, but please feel free to extend the invite to anyone else from Cloudera as you deem required.

 

The specific items we want to cover in this meeting:

1.       Discuss options for configuring ports in CDSW containers for callback messages from hadoop mappers back to driver programs (like H2O) running within the container
2.       Discuss the btrfs file system issue, which brought down GMI CDSW production for ~13 hours on 8/8 – need some visibility on roadmap of when the move away from this filesystem is planned
3.      Discuss diagnostics behind the error with status 128 
Hope the time works for you. Thank you.

Regards,

Reshu
