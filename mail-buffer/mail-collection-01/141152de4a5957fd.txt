Jeff, this is a really good, high-level look at how to handle benchmarking/performance

related customer questions.  I've been thrown a few curveballs by students (although they're few

and far between).  


The video is 15 minutes, and has some great high-level points, as well as pointers to the
int-performance mailing list.  It was a good presentation, and it's worth the 15 minutes to


watch.


The presenter, Yanpei Chen is a good speaker, and he highlights great points how to point out
why Cloudera and our products are top-notch and how to deal with "bake-offs" and other geeky


numbers games that are played by competitors.


Thanks,

--Nate

Probably useful for instructors as well.
