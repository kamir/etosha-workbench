Hello Solr Experts,


I am wondering if anyone did the Solr ingestion performance test before? Base on the public blog from Lucidworks, one can achieve the 101,404 doc/second in a 10 node cluster with 20 shards and replica 1. The average size of each document is 900 byte.

However, this test is based on the Solr 4.8 from Lucidworks, and use the local storage and SSD. What about Cloudera Search (Solr 4.10) with HDFS and HDD?


thanks,
Feng

Hello,

IHAC plan to build a log analysis application on the CDH cluster. They use Flume + Morphline to ingest the log file into SOLR in the near real time. The ingestion rate requirement is 150,000 record/second, around 20MB/s and 1.5TB/day. 


They did a test on a 8 node cdh cluster (6 worker and 2 master). The index collection is configured as 24 shards and replica 1. The ingestion rate is 2000 record/second. If they increase the shard from 24 to 96, the ingestion rate is 10000 record/second.


The worker node's hardware is : 2*8Core, 128GB, 12*4TB. Solr is configured with the 25GB Java Heap.


The questions are:
01 What's the configuration ratio for shards/node?
02 What's the typical NRT ingestion rate for one solr node?
03 how to size a solr cluster to meet this NRT ingestion requirement?


Thanks,
Feng
