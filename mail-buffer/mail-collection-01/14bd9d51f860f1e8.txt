Hello All,


I was delivering a Administration course last week and there were some questions around benchmarking.


1.) Does Cloudera do benchmarking of CDH on various Linux flavors that are supported? Is there any data available on this?

2.) Is there benchmarking data available for CDH for various hardware vendors?


Appreciate if anyone can point me to any sources/ data available on the above two topics. Thanks in advance.
