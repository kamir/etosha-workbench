Gianluca,


Good luck! Please let me know about the decision.

I suggest to schedule a Skype call to prepare the 
next steps, if you like. 



Best wishes 
Mirko

Hello Mirko and Avery,



I'm sending this message just to let you both know that I officially submitted my project proposal to Google Summer of Code, given you two were the ones who showed some interest in supporting the project.

You can take a look at the proposal in Google's Melange platform here: http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/public/google/gsoc2014/gianlucar/5629499534213120




Thanks,

Gianluca Righetto
