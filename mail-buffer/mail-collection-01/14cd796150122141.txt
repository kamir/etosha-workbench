Ok - so that is _one_ option on how to handle it.

I will find out who is using multi-tenant and instead implementing it using Sentry --- I believe MasterCard or Citi might...but it might also be later stages of their projects. 


What they have talked about though is _same_ solr service, but multiple indexes served through it, to different teams. And I believe that is the same as Omneo does, but handling the access to it through their application instead. Per Kevin's comment.

That is all done through the application layer, nothing interesting for us to glean there

Omneo has a full multi-tenant search cluster, some of their indexes are billions of docs, while others are medium sized. I bet the KB can be based on the knowledge we've gained there. Including Kevin and Nick to help produce the content for the KB.

In the meantime, how should we recommend clients do it?  Do we have any clients that have it set up one way or the other?   I know in Boa GIS we only use one service, but all of their collections are small.

I am not aware that we have one. Open a JIRA for a KB?

Hi team,
Do we have any official documentation regarding running multiple tenants on Cloudera Search.  


Do we recommend running it all on 1 service or create multiple services in CM, which means multiple solr cores?


Also if we create multiple services (with the same znode), would we be able to create an alias across different collections?


Thanks a lot,

Jeff
