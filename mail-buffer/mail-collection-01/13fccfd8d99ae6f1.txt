Hi,

This is my personal question, that comes to my mind :) But I assume that it is beneficial for everyone to ask it.


I would like to determine whether my workload is CPU-bound and I configured TaskTracker to run too many (or too few) tasks?



Basically, how CPU contention can be measured on Hadoop nodes. What numbers are the most important? CPU context switches, CPU interruptions, CPU nice/system/wait/idle, size of run queue? What numbers are really BAD and what are GOOD for a multi-core server. 



Thanks for any tips!

Adam
