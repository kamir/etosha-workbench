I tried to hack setup.py, then I can execute pip install, but I couldn't import kudu. Maybe, it depends on sasl, that means we should build .so files for it. I think we have two choises: 1) create custom engine 2) create conda recipe. But I think it should be chosen 3) apache provides whl format binary on PyPi...

Hey Marco, 


Not sure if you got a response on this -- I didn't see one. Scott had been looking at this a month or two ago. He may have some recommendations. Tristan Z gave the following insight on another thread: 


The simplest way would be to use the extensible engines feature and make sure kudu client libs are installed into base container.  It is likely possible you could install these libs locally into the project, but I'm not positive on the required steps.
