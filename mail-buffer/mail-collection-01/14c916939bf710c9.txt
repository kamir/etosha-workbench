Hi Jongwook

If you right-click on the link and select 'download linked file' (or whatever that option is in your browser) it should work fine. Just clicking on the link will open the PDF in a new window or tab in your browser, but it's almost 50MB so it will take a long time to do so.


I just double-checked, and it does definitely download and opens fine on my machine.


Ian.

Hello all,

As Yonah informed you in an earlier email, the Train-the-Trainer for our new Search course is coming up!  Below is the invite to the Webex for the session.


Just to provide some additional information to help you decide if you would like to attend:
Course Description:
Cloudera University’s three-day Search training course is for developers and data engineers who want to index data in Hadoop for more powerful real-time queries and integrate Cloudera Search with external applications. This course is intended for developers, data engineers, and others in technical roles. Students should have at least basic familiarity with Hadoop, and experience programming in a general-purpose language such as Java, C, C++, Perl, or Python. Students should also be comfortable with the Linux command line, and should be able to perform basic tasks such as creating and removing directories, viewing and changing file permissions, executing scripts, and examining file output. No prior experience with Apache Solr or Cloudera Search is required, nor is any experience with HBase or SQL.



TTT Dates: April 7th - 9th
TTT Class times: 7:00am (PT) - 3:00pm (PT)
Format: WebEx (will be recorded)
Participant Best Fit: 
The best candidate to come up to speed to deliver this course would be someone who....
A) Is certified to teach Cloudera Developer
B) Teaches Designing and Building Big Data Appliances. The DABBDA covers some of the technologies used in the Search class (Search itself and Morphlines), so someone who's already up to speed with DABBDA will be able to concentrate more on the new concepts, rather than being hit with completely new things. 
C) Teaches or has observed the HBase course in the past.
D) Teaches or has observed the Administrator course.



As always, If you have any questions please let us know,
      -annette
