Your copy+paste seems to indicate a root shell - what user did you kinit as?  What does klist show?

Hi,

I just ran into a strange issue with customer. I issued Teragen and terasort tests on clusters (Kerberized, secured). Teragen ran without any problems. But when I ran Terasort on encryption zone. 


Under Kerberized cluster, the job should run as user itself not as "yarn". This makes this issure more strange.


Any ideas?


# hadoop jar /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/jars/hadoop-examples.jar terasort -Dmapreduce.job.reduces=30 -Dmapreduce.job.maps=30 /tmp/testZone0/5-18-teragen /tmp/testZone0/5-18-1-terasort
