             Summary: Provide a Strongly Connected Components algorithm
                 Key: GIRAPH-931
                 URL: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GIRAPH-931
             Project: Giraph
          Issue Type: Improvement
          Components: examples
            Reporter: Gianluca Righetto
            Priority: Minor


Provide an implementation of an algorithm for finding strongly connected components in a graph to augment the giraph-examples library. This has been initially proposed on GSoC'14.
A handful of graph algorithms have been researched in this paper: "Optimizing Graph Algorithms on Pregel-like Systems" (Salihoglu, S., Widom, J., 2014), and a detailed explanation of SCC can also be found in it.
