Hi team and Kathleen --


I'm teaching at Lowe's this week and the students are asking about

throttling Sqoop to only import "X" GB of data from a Teradata system

in Y amount of time.

The reason is that Sqoop is causing the Teradata system's production operations to get bottlenecked.


Any pointers/references would be great --


Thanks!
