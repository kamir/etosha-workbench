Hello Mirko and Avery,

I'm sending this message just to let you both know that I officially submitted my project proposal to Google Summer of Code, given you two were the ones who showed some interest in supporting the project.
You can take a look at the proposal in Google's Melange platform here:Â http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/public/google/gsoc2014/gianlucar/5629499534213120


Thanks,
Gianluca Righetto
