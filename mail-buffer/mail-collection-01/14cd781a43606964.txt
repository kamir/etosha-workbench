Omneo has a full multi-tenant search cluster, some of their indexes are billions of docs, while others are medium sized. I bet the KB can be based on the knowledge we've gained there. Including Kevin and Nick to help produce the content for the KB.

In the meantime, how should we recommend clients do it?  Do we have any clients that have it set up one way or the other?   I know in Boa GIS we only use one service, but all of their collections are small.

I am not aware that we have one. Open a JIRA for a KB?

Hi team,
Do we have any official documentation regarding running multiple tenants on Cloudera Search.  


Do we recommend running it all on 1 service or create multiple services in CM, which means multiple solr cores?


Also if we create multiple services (with the same znode), would we be able to create an alias across different collections?


Thanks a lot,

Jeff
