Hi Bhavuk,




This is done by specifying the --prefix option when installing the packages:





  
http://www.rpm.org/max-rpm/s1-rpm-install-additional-options.html#S2-RPM-INSTALL-PREFIX









However, that option is only valid if the specific package being installed supports relocation. My recollection is that few packages do support that (regardless of whether they come from CDH, CentOS, or somewhere else).





I guess my question would be, "Why would you want to do that?" For mission-critical systems, especially for something like Hadoop that involves the integration of many different components, I personally prefer to stick with the defaults unless there's
 a compelling reason to change them. Since it would be impossible to test every possible combination, it's reasonable to assume that the default settings receive the most attention, and therefore you'll encounter the fewest problems if you stick close to them.
 You'd almost certainly run Hadoop on dedicated servers that you provisioned specifically for it, so the usual reasons to change installation paths (e.g., "I'm running out of space on /usr") should not be a problem here. 





Regarding your other question, everything in CDH is open source. The source tarballs, along with release notes and a list of specific patches applied to each package, can be found in the "CDH Packaging and Tarball Information" page in the documentation
 for a specific release of CDH. Here's the one for the latest version:

Hope that helps,





Tom

Hi All



I got a query in Admin Course about how to change default installation paths of RPM files.



Do we need to compile these from source? If yes, then please point me to correct location where I can get the source?





Regards!
