Gianluca Righetto updated GIRAPH-931:
-------------------------------------

    Attachment: GIRAPH-931.patch

This patch contains an SCC implementation along with an in-memory test to verify the code. This algorithm has also been tested on a real cluster using Wikipedia and Twitter datasets found on Stanford SNAP's website (http://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html).

> Provide an implementation of an algorithm for finding strongly connected components in a graph to augment the giraph-examples library. This has been initially proposed on GSoC'14.
> A handful of graph algorithms have been researched in this paper: "Optimizing Graph Algorithms on Pregel-like Systems" (Salihoglu, S., Widom, J., 2014), and a detailed explanation of SCC can also be found in it.
