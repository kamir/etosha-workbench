+1 Advantage to CDSW.

There is another interesting conversation on governance in CDSW.  Having the history like Marty suggested could be beneficial in this area as well, you can easily go back and see how results have changed over time, either based on changes in data or changes in code.  If you are really prudent, you could even mark when you made changes in the output so you know why the results changed (ie added this file to result or committed this change to version control).

    I would disagree with:  "In the CDSW, we prefer to clear and rerun
    all the script as a plain report."  

    

    I highlight sections of the code and re-run them, for example
    changing the number of clusters in a k-means analysis.  

    

    We have an advantage over notebooks - our session saves all the
    output so you can see what happened and how you got to the final
    analysis.  Notebooks overwrites this history.  

    

    An example of a session from CDSW, with two runs of kmeans is
    attached.  Notice the two iterations of the kmeans and the graph are
    in the session.  Notebooks doesn't do this unless you make copies of
    the code blocks.

    

    ADVANTAGE CDSW :-)

      Hi guys,
        

        

        during my two last demoes I got a specific question
          comparing our CDSW with notebooks.

          The scientist explained that in normal notebooks, they are
          capable to replay parts of the code or refresh portions of the
          graphic displayed (in frames I think).

        In the CDSW, we prefer to clear and rerun all the script as
          a plain report.

        

        

        Could anyone with experience in notebooks clarify this
          comparison and help me to give the right answer ?

        

        

        Thanks
