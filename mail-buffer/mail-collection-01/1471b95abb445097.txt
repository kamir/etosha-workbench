Dear Team,

Had a couple of questions, would be great if someone can help:


1. While connecting BeeLine, we are using the hostname and port. Is there a configuration that I can put in my hive-site so that I dont have to specify the hostname and port everytime.



2. On the YARN UI, we see Â User Metrics for dr.who, what exactly is dr.who and how can that be changed. I understand its a default user, but some more light on that would be great.



3. For HiveServer2 also, we require metastore service, why HIverserver2 to MySQL connectivity was directly preferred.


Please help me with the same.


Thank You
