For me the best piece of advice, hard-won from my own days in hardware pre-sales support (and teaching performances classes on Solaris and HotSpot JVMs) is this:

* Do not give performance numbers. 



The video says "be last," or at least do not be first, as those numbers become a target to beat. Any salesperson hungry to make their numbers will beat them -- it hardly matters if the playing field they provide is real or fictional.



More importantly, numbers _always_ get removed from context -- configuration, hardware class, networking (if appropriate), workload -- they all point to a very specific stack, and performance is always, always, always tied to the workload used. Always.



If I write always four times in a row it's because anxious students in a performance-oriented class will try every hour to get numbers, which they call evidence or even proof of your product's viability. Even right after I say there is no such thing as a performance measurement in which a specific workload and configuration is somehow irrelevant. There is also no such thing as a general case that is applicable to a class of workloads. In my oh-so-humble view, this includes benchmarks. 



So an additional two cents coming from no one in particular: this is great advice. It's not about being cagey, it's just awareness that your customer will try to put you in a position where, as a product advocate, you can only lose. They're not usually trying to do exactly that, but that's what it amounts to.



FWIW,


Michael

To quote Nate Neff:


"... this is a really good, high-level look at how to handle benchmarking/performance
related customer questions.  I've been thrown a few curveballs by students (although they're few



and far between).  


The video is 15 minutes, and has some great high-level points, as well as pointers to the
int-performance mailing list.  It was a good presentation, and it's worth the 15 minutes to




watch.


The presenter, Yanpei Chen is a good speaker, and he highlights great points how to point out
why Cloudera and our products are top-notch and how to deal with "bake-offs" and other geeky




numbers games that are played by competitors...."
