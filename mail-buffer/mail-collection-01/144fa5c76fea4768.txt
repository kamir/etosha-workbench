Hallo Mirko, wie geht's Ihnen? (it's not always I get the chance to practice my beginner-level german)


Thanks for getting back to me!I agree with you on the Skype call, that's a good idea, we should schedule one in the near future, but maybe we can wait a little more until the project gets accepted. Well, actually even if it gets rejected, I'd like to work with you on that proposal.
My Skype id is gian89.


I'll let you know when they announce the final decision.


Best regards,
Gianluca Righetto

Gianluca,


Good luck! Please let me know about the decision.

I suggest to schedule a Skype call to prepare the 
next steps, if you like. 



Best wishes 
Mirko

Hello Mirko and Avery,



I'm sending this message just to let you both know that I officially submitted my project proposal to Google Summer of Code, given you two were the ones who showed some interest in supporting the project.

You can take a look at the proposal in Google's Melange platform here: http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/public/google/gsoc2014/gianlucar/5629499534213120




Thanks,

Gianluca Righetto
