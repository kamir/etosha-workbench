Hi guys,

during my two last demoes I got a specific question comparing our CDSW with notebooks.
The scientist explained that in normal notebooks, they are capable to replay parts of the code or refresh portions of the graphic displayed (in frames I think).
In the CDSW, we prefer to clear and rerun all the script as a plain report.


Could anyone with experience in notebooks clarify this comparison and help me to give the right answer ?


Thanks
