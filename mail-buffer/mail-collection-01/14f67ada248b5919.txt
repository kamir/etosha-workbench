  The student @ Dell said it can be very 
tedious and unrewarding -- I was surprised!   I've always thought that 
perf. tuning was the stuff the smart kids do.  






This came out wrong -- I meant to say I thought perf. testing and

engineering was an awesome, glory filled role that everyone clamored for,

and that the hallways parted and heads bowed to perf. engineers as they

walk past on their way to the cafeteria.


But I hear that's not always the case :)
