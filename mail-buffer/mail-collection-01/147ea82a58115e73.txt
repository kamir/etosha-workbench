The performance guide should be able to give you the input on that... if not, please reach out to Yanpei to discuss...

Thanks Eva!

The customer's original question was specifically about having multiple instances of Lily - do we have any idea how many HBase transactions a single Lily indexer can handle?  Or is Lily unlikely to be the bottleneck?

Solr sizing is pending on 1) data ingest rate 2) what part of the data you need to search over and what questions you plan to serve (index schema) 3) SLAs expected on response times and indexing completion time







A lot of good info is collected here: https://cloudera.app.box.com/files/0/f/946449307/2013_Solr_videos








On sizing particularly check out the sizing form.


It basically comes down to:
* continuously increase data ingest for _one node of solr_ of the sample data using the index schema you plan to use






* see where the node fails to serve indexing or query SLAs
* extrapolate from there to how many nodes you need for a given expected ingest rate, e.g. do the math...


Erick Erickson can help. There is also a performance guide in SFDC that you can read.

IHAC with a question about the Lily indexer, specifically what you gain by having multiple instances.








The Lily wiki (https://github.com/NGDATA/hbase-indexer/wiki) mentions that indexing work "is shared over all machines in the cluster", but do we have any information (or even ballpark numbers) to estimate how many indexers you need for a given workload?
