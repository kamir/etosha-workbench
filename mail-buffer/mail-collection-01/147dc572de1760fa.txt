IHAC with a question about the Lily indexer, specifically what you gain by having multiple instances.


The Lily wiki (https://github.com/NGDATA/hbase-indexer/wiki) mentions that indexing work "is shared over all machines in the cluster", but do we have any information (or even ballpark numbers) to estimate how many indexers you need for a given workload?
