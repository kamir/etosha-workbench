Currently, they can mount the NAS to each CDSW host, then bind mount the mountpoints into CDSW from the administration panel. Will that work for them?

I understand that we can upload the files to container from CDSW but one of my customers is asking if we can mount NAS folder within CDSW container. They want to implement dropbox kind of functionality to exchange files between local folder and the container. Please let me know if this is possible or any better way of doing it.

Thanks,
Sreekanth
