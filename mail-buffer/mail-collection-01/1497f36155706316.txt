Dear Team,


Am teaching developer class, and a student asked about speculative execution.


Now the question is 

"Speculative execution is an act of JT/AM, running one more instance of tasks that may be running slow somewhere. How does the framework ensure that the new copy of task will not end up on a slow machine or would not end up being slow."


Next phase of the question is

"In case JT/AM schedules the new speculated task and that also runs slower than expected, will JT/AM continue running both slow tasks or it will suspend one and try somewhere else"


Thank You
