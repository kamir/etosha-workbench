On page 7-29 of the book you will find the following code.

  @Override
  public List<Event> intercept(List<Event> events) {
    List<Event> result = new ArrayList<Event>();
    for (Event event : events) {
        Event intercepted = intercept(event);
        result.add(intercepted);
    }
    return result;

My question is: Why do we need the result list in this example?
All we are doing is modifying a header in each event instance.
Why not simply return the original list with its modified headers?

Am I missing something?

Thanks,
