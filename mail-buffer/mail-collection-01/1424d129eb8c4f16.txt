Hi folks

I don't usually pepper this mailing list with single link e-mails, but if you teach Admin you've probably had at least a few students ask whether Infiniband is a good idea. This answer from Cloudera's Eric Sammer is a great summation of the pros and cons; well worth reading if you teach Admin (or even if you don't...).
