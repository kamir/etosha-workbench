Actually, this is not quite correct. We recommend setting swappiness to 0. That tells the kernel to swap only to avoid an out of memory condition. (Setting it to 0 does not forbid the kernel to swap -- rather, to swap only if it absolutely must.)






The swappiness param tells the kernel how far in advance of needing to swap, it should start to swap. 
So yes, setting it to 0 does not prevent swapping.  It just waits until there is no RAM left to start swapping - your only if it absolutely must condition. However, if the system cannot write to disk (swap) faster than the additional RAM is needed (new process starting), something gets killed off to make the space. Hopefully this is something not critical to the system and a kernel panic is avoided.



By setting the swappiness to 5 you say that when only 5% of my RAM is left (95% is in use), I should start dumping stuff (the least used process) to disk (swap) so that "stuff"'s RAM can be made available if needed without killing the process. it is kinda like a buffering or staging action. Meanwhile, admins should monitor for this swap occurring and evaluate the need of tuning or upgrading.



Note the default in the Linux kernel is to start this staging process when 60% of RAM is left (only 40% has been used).  I definitely recommend changing the default value.  But like Michael, my experiences in the field have seen too many kernel panics with swappiness at 0.  I also recommend 5.

in /etc/sysctl.conf add the following: vm.swappiness = 5

Don’t go to zero, because if it tries to swap and isn’t allowed to, ugly things happen. With a swappiness of 5, it waits till 95% RAM usage. When it can’t swap, the OOM Killer comes out, often with bad results for your running processes. Yes, swapping is bad. Having a node shot in the head by OOM is worse. 



Of course the real answer if you are swapping after setting swappiness to 5 is to either tweak down max mappers and max reducers or upgrade RAM to sustain the mappers and reducers. The math for it is easy. 1.5 x number of cores x 4G(max recommended heap for tasks) + 1G for OS = good starting point for RAM. 



I have a student this week who had a “Hadoop Consultant” not from Cloudera recommend 4G of RAM per slave node, which tells me that guy has never looked at the current recommendations.

Hi Martin,




I think you can set the vm.swappiness sysctl option on linux OS level to 0. To the best of my knowledge this is the setting you need.





Cheers Kris

Hi Friends,

    I have a cluster with 5 machines, CDH 4.6.0, everything is fine except sometimes it shows the yellow warn "swapping". Usually after running a job, also appear when the whole cluster keep idle for several days.



    I googled a lot, but can't find a way to avoid these kind of swapping. Can you help me?
