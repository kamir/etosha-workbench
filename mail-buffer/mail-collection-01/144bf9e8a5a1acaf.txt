Hi Friends,
    I have a cluster with 5 machines, CDH 4.6.0, everything is fine except sometimes it shows the yellow warn "swapping". Usually after running a job, also appear when the whole cluster keep idle for several days.

    I googled a lot, but can't find a way to avoid these kind of swapping. Can you help me?
