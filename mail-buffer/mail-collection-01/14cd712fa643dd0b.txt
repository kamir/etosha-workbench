Hi team,
Do we have any official documentation regarding running multiple tenants on Cloudera Search. Â 


Do we recommend running it all on 1 service or create multiple services in CM, which means multiple solr cores?


Also if we create multiple services (with the same znode), would we be able to create an alias across different collections?


Thanks a lot,

Jeff
