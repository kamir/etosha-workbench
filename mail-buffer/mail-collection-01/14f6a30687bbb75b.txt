Wonderful stuff, Nate. Strongly agreed that perf testing is something that "everyone wants" but few really understand - especially in terms of what the numbers mean. My approach to this demand is to give them a really basic benchmark with many a caveat ("Beware - Here Be Dragons", "All Hope Abandon Ye Who Press <Enter> Here", etc.) - using Teragen for HDFS write speeds and bandwidth testing, and maybe, just maybe if they beg on bended knee, Terasort for a high-water mark for their current configuration. It also makes for a nice little diversion - one that everyone seems to enjoy - if you're running short of material during Admin. :)


E.g.:


# Show them the cool toys included with Hadoop

find /usr/lib/hadoop* -iname '*example*jar'


# Use any one of the returned JAR files to see what's available

hadoop jar /path/to/one/of/the/above/jars


# Use the node CPU to toast your bagels in the morning
hadoop jar hadoop-examples.jar pi <MAX_MAPPERS_IN_CLUSTER> 1000000000


# 100GB being written to HDFS is the ultimate excuse for a coffee break

hadoop jar hadoop-examples.jar teragen -D dfs.replication=1 -D mapred.map.tasks=<MAX_MAPPERS_IN_CLUSTER> 100000000 teragen_test


# Have you ever seen smoke coming from a network card?
hadoop jar hadoop-examples.jar teragen -D mapred.map.tasks=<MAX_MAPS_IN_CLUSTER> 100000000 teragen_test



(This last test is reputed to create 3-9X the network activity as compared to the average operating level; see the wonderful "Fanatics" writeup by PS at https://cloudera.app.box.com/files/1/s/distcp/1/f_22314148599 .)



That seems to satisfy even the most demanding "I must have the metrics for my cluster" student. However, I will now also be recommending the "pitfalls" writeup as a part of this process - for those students who actually *care* about making the numbers meaningful.

Nah, it's a cult of personality thing. Guys like ATM and The Sammer get that treatment wherever they go, and the rest of us can only look on with green envy. :) But, y'know - a few more posts like this one, and you too might join their hallowed ranks...



Really good stuff, thanks!
