I successfully tested the code on a pseudo-distributed cluster and on a small dev-cluster with 10 map slots.
The test-cluster was CDH4.5 and I used the profile "-P hadoop_2".



I will check / update the literature references to have also this paper: "Optimizing Graph Algorithms on Pregel-like Systems" (Salihoglu, S., Widom, J., 2014) on the official Giraph website.



Best wishes from London

Gianluca Righetto updated GIRAPH-931:

-------------------------------------



    Attachment: GIRAPH-931.patch



This patch contains an SCC implementation along with an in-memory test to verify the code. This algorithm has also been tested on a real cluster using Wikipedia and Twitter datasets found on Stanford SNAP's website (http://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html).
