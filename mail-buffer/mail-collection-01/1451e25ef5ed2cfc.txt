In this blog post, it says:Is HBase an optimal storage medium for the given use case?

I want to double check that this refers to the usual HBase caveats that one would have for any HBase project or are there extra caveats associated with Search + HBase? The article talks about slow downs due to writes, etc. Are there others?



Thanks,


Jesse
