This is in response to a cry for help on TGCTT channel

regarding a student req. for "Benchmarking tools for Impala".




TL;DR .........


Psyche!  There is no TL; DR.  Here's some soapbox and gag-inducing
"experiences" that I'll reflect on, to make me feel like I know something!
<Evil Laugh>



Some students at Dell who had decades of tuning/optimization experience

told me the same thing that Ian mentioned on Skype.  Benchmarking and

performance tuning is a moving target, and is very ripe for making numbers

and stats say whatever is wanted.  The student @ Dell said it can be very 
tedious and unrewarding -- I was surprised!   I've always thought that 
perf. tuning was the stuff the smart kids do.  

To back up the point -- this Cloudera blog lists some of the "pitfalls" that the 
student also mentioned :-O

http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2014/12/5-pitfalls-of-benchmarking-big-data-systems/


Anyway, with that being said, most students (in my experience) simply want

to ask "Hey, if we're using Impala it's supposed to be fast, so how can we

make sure it runs fast, and how can we measure our performance and possibly

tune it?"  -- Which is a very reasonable question to ask, especially for a product

whose entire GOAL is to be fast.


I know I will have forgotten some obvious things, so please post them here

if they're public / referenceable or if they're private, but easily summarizable

(e.g. some engineers use <some tool that's widely known> to gather stats

from Impala when performance tuning)


1.  The Cloudera official docs

http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/documentation/cloudera-impala/latest/topics/impala_performance.html


I try to guide students to Cloudera's official documentation (and/or blogs)

first and foremost, because well, it's public information and I think it's 

pretty good, as well.


2.  Try the blogs (under Impala) This is the killer slide presentation 
I was alluding to earlier (It's been updated in August 2015 !) And again, it's public info,

so send the student the link, and away you go!


http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2014/12/the-impala-cookbook/


(Okay, I figured out where I saw the link to this blog, it was in 
this FCE mailing list e-mail from March titled "SQL Benchmarking") 

https://groups.google.com/a/cloudera.com/forum/#!search/sql$20benchmarks/fce/oE4gvQWN-X0/p_mOlOYEon4J



I recommend just pointing the students at the above two resources.


Any other Impala benchmarking / performance tuning docs or public

links are appreciated.


3. Don't be afraid to send an e-mail and ask.  Don't abuse the system,

but the system is there to be used -- we're (Education) are part of FCE

and we are in front of customers for 8 hours a day.  It's okay to send a quick

e-mail and ask these kinds of questions - I try to mention the research I've done
and any ideas I might have, so show that I've put some effort into finding the answer myself,
and I'm not just using the mailing lists as my minions :)



Thanks,

[1] Odyssey continues

I try to find stuff on the wiki and e-mail lists (like FCE).  For example, I

searched for "Impala" on the wiki and found this page (3rd hit):

https://wiki.cloudera.com/display/engineering/Impala+Experts+Team


However, this is a bunch of internal (and really killer stuff), but not consumable

quickly.  (There's certainly cool benchmarking stuff like "Reading Query Performance",

but again , it's internal)


Then I found this internal wiki page in the search results on the wiki,
which again, looks like a ton of great info, but internal:
